In this project, you'll classify images from the _CIFAR-10 dataset_. 
The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 
The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. 
You'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. 
At then end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images.

## Concepts Learnt:
 - Convolutional Neural Network
 - Training on the Cloud (FloydHub)
