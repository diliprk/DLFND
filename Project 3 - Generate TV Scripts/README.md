In this project we automate the generation of a TV script for a scene in a TV show using a sample dataset.
We wil generate our own _Simpsons_ TV scripts using RNNs. A part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons is provided.
The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at _Moe's Tavern_.
